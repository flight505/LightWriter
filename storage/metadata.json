Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma generally benefit from treatment with ALL-like regimens versus traditional lymphoma therapy18,19 and should be treated in a center that has experience with lymphoblastic lymphoma.\n\nHematopathology evaluations should include morphologic examination of malignant lymphocytes using Wright-Giemsa–stained slides and hematoxylin and eosin–stained core biopsy and clot sections; comprehensive immunophenotyping with flow cytometry (see the full version of the discussion section in these guidelines for more details on immunophenotyping); and baseline characterization of leukemic clone(s)—by flow cytometry, or identification of clonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements—to facilitate subsequent analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD).\n\n# Genetic Abnormalities and Molecular Subtypes\n\nIdentification of specific recurrent genetic abnormalities is critical for disease evaluation, optimal risk stratification, and treatment planning. Subtypes of B-ALL with recurrent genetic abnormalities include the following: hyperdiploidy (51–67 chromosomes); hypodiploidy (,44 chromosomes); t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), BCR-ABL1; t(v;11q23.3), KMT2A rearranged; t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1), ETV6-RUNX1; t(1;19)(q23;p13.3), TCF3-PBX1; and t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.1), IL3-IGH. 20 During the 2016 WHO classification update, 2 new provisional entities were added to the B-ALL classification: B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with translocations involving tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptors (BCR-ABL1–like ALL or Ph-like ALL)21,22 and B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21).21,23 Two new provisional entities were also added to T-ALL: early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia and natural killer cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.21\n\nIn these guidelines, the NCCN Panel for Pediatric ALL has delineated the features that are commonly associated\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nwith favorable or unfavorable outcomes in B-ALL (see \"Genetic Risk Groups for B-ALL,\" available in these guidelines at NCCN.org). A brief summary is also provided in this discussion for genetic features associated with T-ALL.\n\n#### Favorable Risk Features\n\nAmong children with ALL, the most common chromosomal abnormality is hyperdiploidy (.50 chromosomes) as seen in 25% of cases of B-ALL compared with 7% in the adult ALL patient population.24,25 The ETV6-RUNX1 subtype (also within the B-cell lineage) resulting from chromosomal translocation t(12;21) is also among the most commonly occurring subtypes in childhood ALL (25%) compared with adults (2%).24,25 Both hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 subtypes are associated with favorable outcomes in pediatric ALL,26 and occur less frequently among AYA patients compared with younger children.24\n\n#### Unfavorable Risk Features\n\nSeveral chromosomal abnormalities are well-recognized prognostic biomarkers of high-risk disease at all ages, including low hypodiploidy (30–39 chromosomes), near haploidy (,30 chromosomes), KMT2A (MLL) translocations, t(17;19)/TCF3-HLF fusion, and BCR-ABL1. 27 Hypodiploidy is associated with poor prognosis and is observed in 1%–2% of pediatric patients.28–30 Of note, low hypodiploidy is associated with a high frequency of TP53 alterations, which are germline in ;50% of cases.31,32\n\nChromosomal rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene, previously referred to as the human mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, occur in approximately 5% of pediatric ALL cases, with a higher incidence in infants (;70%–80%).33–36 These KMT2A rearrangements, including cases with t(4;11) translocation, are associated with poor outcomes, especially in infants.37,38 The translocation t(17;19)(q22;p13), resulting in the fusion gene TCF3-HLF, defines a rare subtype of pediatric ALL (,1%) and is associated with poor outcomes.39,40 Conversely, another translocation t(1;19) that results in the fusion gene TCF3-PBX1 occurs in approximately 5% of pediatric ALL cases and is associated with intermediate outcomes.39,41\n\nB-ALL with iAMP21 is characterized by amplification of a portion of chromosome 21, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe for the RUNX1 gene.42,43 Occurring in approximately 2% of children with ALL, B-ALL with iAMP21 is associated with adverse prognosis when treated with low-intensity regimens.42,43 Children with iAMP21 are typically older, with a median\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nage of 9 years, and have low platelet counts and low white blood cell (WBC) counts.44\n\nBCR-ABL1– or Ph-positive ALL is associated with poor prognosis and is relatively uncommon among childhood ALL (2%), whereas this subtype is more common among adults (25%).24,25 The frequency of Ph-positive ALL increases with age, and younger children (1–9 years) with Ph-positive ALL have a better prognosis than adolescents with this subtype.45,46\n\nIn B-ALL, mutations in the Ikaros gene (IKZF1) are seen in approximately 15%–20% of patients with pediatric B-ALL47,48 and at a higher frequency of .75% in patients who are also BCR-ABL1 positive.47,49 In many studies, IKZF1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis and a greater incidence of relapse.49,50 An analysis of the MRD-dependent prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletions with co-occurring deletions in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, PAX5, or PAR1 in the absence of ERG deletion conferred poor outcomes in pediatric patients with B-ALL.51 Emerging data suggests that an intragenic ERG deletion is associated with favorable outcomes in pediatric B-ALL, and in this context, co-occurring IKZF1 deletions do not affect prognosis.52,53\n\nBCR-ABL1–like or Ph-like ALL is a subgroup of B-ALL associated with unfavorable prognosis that occurs in approximately 15% of pediatric patients with ALL.22,54,55 A study using gene expression signatures to classify pediatric patients with ALL into subtypes estimated the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the BCR-ABL1–like ALL group to be 60%.22 In adult patients with BCR-ABL1–like ALL, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) is significantly lower (22.5%; 95% CI, 14.9%–29.3%) compared with patients with non–BCR-ABL1–like ALL (49.3%; 95% CI, 42.8%–56.2%).56 Although this subgroup is Ph-negative, they show an otherwise similar genetic profile to the Ph-positive ALL subgroup, including an IKZF1 mutation.49 A study evaluating the relationship between BCR-ABL1–like and IKZF1 in children with B-cell precursor ALL showed that 40% of cases had co-occurrence of these mutations.57 The presence of the BCR-ABL1-like signature and an IKZF1 deletion were indicative of poor prognosis independent of conventional risk factors.57 Genomically, the Ph-like subtype is typically associated with gene fusions and mutations that activate tyrosine kinase pathways as the common mechanism of transformation. These gene fusions and mutations include ABL-class rearrangements (ie, ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRA, PDGFRb, FGFR), JAK-STAT rearrangements and/or mutations (ie, CRLF2, 58 EPOR, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, SH2B3, IL7R) and other rearrangements in FLT3, NTRK3, LYN,\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nand, PTK2B genes.22,59,60 Genomic profiling studies have found that at least 80% of Ph-like ALL cases have cytokine receptor- or kinase-activating alterations, suggesting potential for ABL-class tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or JAK small molecule inhibitors to significantly improve patient outcomes in this subgroup.59–61\n\n#### Genetic Abnormalities Associated With T-ALL\n\nT-ALL is characterized by activating mutations of NOTCH1, and rearrangements of transcription factors TLX1 (HOX11), TLX3 (HOX11L2), LYL1, TAL1, and KMT2A. 55,62 More than 50% of T-ALL cases have activating NOTCH1 mutations, and approximately 10%–15% of T-ALL cases have mutations in the NOTCH1-targeting E3 ligase FBXW7, which leads to prolonged NOTCH1 activation.63–65 In patients with T-ALL, NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations have generally been associated with favorable prognosis and lower MRD levels.66–68 However, it is unclear if these mutations are independent predictors of outcome, or if there needs to be concurrent absence of RAS or PTEN mutations.69–71\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Genetic Characterization\n\nThe presence of recurrent genetic abnormalities should be evaluated using karyotyping of G-banded metaphase chromosomes (conventional cytogenetics), interphase FISH assays, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (see PEDALL-1, page 82). FISH probes and RT-PCR primers should include those capable of detecting major recurrent genetic abnormalities. RT-PCR should measure transcript sizes (ie, p190 vs p210) of BCR-ABL1 in B-ALL. If samples are ETV6-RUNX1– and BCR-ABL1–negative, testing for other gene fusions and mutations associated with Ph-like ALL is encouraged in some patients, and may aid in risk stratification. Recurrent gene fusions and mutations that activate tyrosine kinase pathways and are associated with Ph-like ALL include gene fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, or PDGFRB (gene fusions) and mutations involving CRLF2, FLT3, IL7R, SH2B3, JAK1, JAK3, and JAK2 (in combination with CRLF2 gene fusions).60,72 Low-density arrays,73 next-generation sequencing (NGS)–based assays, and multiplex RT-PCR are typically used to detect signature or cryptic rearrangements and mutations characteristic of Ph-like ALL. Additional FISH probes that may be useful to consider include centromeric probes for chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 to detect hyperdiploidy; CDKN2A at 9p21.3 to detect deletions; probes to detect cryptic t(X;14)(p22;q32)/t(Y;14)(p11;q32) IGH-CRLF2 rearrangements; and probes to detect cryptic JAK2 and\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nFGFR1 rearrangements.74 In cases of aneuploidy or failed karyotype, additional assessment may include a microarray comparative genomic hybridization.\n\n# Workup\n\nThe initial workup for patients with ALL should include a thorough medical history and physical examination along with laboratory and imaging studies, where applicable (See PEDALL-2, page 84). Laboratory studies include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets and differential, a blood chemistry profile, liver function tests, and disseminated intravascular coagulation panel (including measurements for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time). The blood chemistry panel should include a tumor lysis syndrome panel (including measurements for serum lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, potassium, phosphates, and calcium). Female patients should undergo pregnancy testing and all male patients should be evaluated for testicular involvement of disease, including a scrotal ultrasound as indicated; testicular involvement is rare in ALL (1%–2% of males), but is slightly more common in T-ALL than B-ALL. Fertility counseling and/or preservation options should be presented to all patients.\n\nAppropriate imaging studies should also be performed to detect meningeal disease, chloromas, or CNS bleeding for patients with major neurologic signs or symptoms at diagnosis. If neurologic symptoms are observed, a CT/MRI scan of the head with contrast is recommended. To rule out mediastinal masses, a chest X-ray is recommended. If lymphoblastic lymphoma is suspected, a whole body PET/CT scan is recommended. CNS involvement should be evaluated through lumbar puncture at timing that is consistent with the treatment protocol. Pediatric-inspired regimens typically include lumbar puncture and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy at the time of diagnostic workup. The NCCN Pediatric ALL Panel recommends that the first intrathecal therapy be performed at initial scheduled lumbar puncture unless directed by symptoms to perform earlier (see full version of these guidelines for \"NCCN Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment of Extramedullary Involvement,\" available online at NCCN.org).\n\nAll patients should be evaluated for opportunistic infections as appropriate. In addition, an echocardiogram or cardiac scan should be considered for all patients due to the use of anthracyclines as the backbone of nearly all treatment regimens. Assessment of cardiac function is particularly important for patients with prior cardiac\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nhistory, prior anthracycline exposure, or clinical symptoms suggestive of cardiac dysfunction. To appropriately tailor doses of select components of chemotherapy, including thiopurines, and minimize adverse effects during treatment, pharmacogenomic testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleoside diphosphate– linked moiety X-type motif (nudix hydrolase 15, NUDT15) should be considered. For dosing guidelines for thiopurines based on TPMT and NUDT15 phenotype, see the \"Pharmacogenomics\" section (available online, in these guidelines, at NCCN.org).\n\nDuring the workup, it is important to consider the potential influence of any ALL predisposition syndromes. A growing number of germline mutations associated with ALL risk have been reported.75 Importantly, children with Down syndrome are at an increased risk for the development of ALL.76 For non-Down syndrome–related ALL, most patients do not have an identifiable leukemia predisposition syndrome. An exception is low-hypodiploid ALL, in which germline TP53 mutations are common and testing should be considered.\n\nIt should be noted that the recommendations included in the guidelines represent a minimum set of workup considerations and that other evaluations or testing may be needed based on clinical symptoms. Procurement of cells should be considered for purposes of future research (in accordance with institutional practices or policies).\n\n# Prognostic Factors and Risk Stratification\n\nVarious disease-related and patient-specific factors may have prognostic significance in patients with ALL. In particular, patient age, WBC count, immunophenotypic/ cytogenetic/genetic subtype, presence of CNS disease, and response to therapy have been identified as important factors in defining risk and assessing prognosis for both childhood and adult ALL.\n\nInitially, risk assessment for childhood ALL was individually determined primarily by the institution, complicating the interpretation of data. However, in 1993, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and Children's Cancer Group (CCG) established a common set of risk criteria.77 In this system, 2 risk groups were designated: standard risk and high risk. Standard risk was assigned to patients aged 1 to ,10 years and with a WBC count less than 503109 cells/L, whereas all other patients with ALL, including T-ALL (regardless of age or WBC count), were considered high risk.30\n\nDifferent cooperative groups have used a combination of clinical, biologic, and response variables to allocate patients into risk groups based on outcome.30,74,78\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nSome cooperative groups subdivide patients into 5 or more different risk groups that are used to tailor therapy. In B-ALL, patients with high-risk or very-high-risk disease have been found to have any of the following characteristics: t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (ie, Ph-positive ALL) and/or presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene; hypodiploidy (,44 chromosomes)79; BCR-ABL1–like or Ph-like ALL59; iAMP2142,80; patients younger than age 1 with KMT2A gene rearrangement,34,80 or failure to achieve remission with induction therapy.30 Conversely, criteria were refined for lower risk and included patients with hyperdiploidy, especially with simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17,30,81 and the t(12;21) chromosomal translocation (ETV6-RUNX1 subtype).82 The presence or absence of extramedullary disease and the early response to treatment (eg, MRD) also modified risk.\n\nRisk stratification of T-ALL has been challenging, because other than MRD measurements, the clinical variables used to classify risk in B-ALL, including age and WBC counts, are not independently prognostic in T-ALL.83 Although T-ALL is often categorized as high risk depending on the institution, newer treatment options have resulted in improved survival outcomes for these patients.83–86 Furthermore, the identification of genetic mutations and the use of targeted therapies may change the way T-ALL is treated and ultimately how these patients are assessed for risk.\n\nThe POG and CCG have since merged to form the Children's Oncology Group (COG), and subsequent risk assessment has produced additional risk factors to further refine therapy.80 In the United States, other groups have also developed standards for risk-stratified treatment approaches, including the St. Jude Consortium87–89 and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium.78,90,91 Initial risk stratification for these cooperative groups integrates the NCI criteria such that patients are classified as being low, standard, high, or very high risk (see \"Risk Stratification Definitions, Initial Risk Group Stratification,\" available online, in these guidelines, at NCCN.org). After induction remission therapy, each group applies additional risk-stratified criteria (see \"Risk Stratification Definitions, Post-Induction Therapy Risk Group Stratification,\" in the algorithm at NCCN.org). The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Group categorizes risk based ¨ on several factors, including MRD, poor prednisone response, evidence of MLL/AF4, and hypodiploidy.92,93\n\n#### COG Approach\n\nIn the COG approach, patients with B-ALL are initially classified as standard risk (ie, aged 1 to ,10 years and WBC\n\n![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\ncount ,503109 cells/L) or high risk (ie, aged",

In addition, high EOI MRD and persistent MRD are features of high-risk and very-high-risk disease.\n\nFor AYA patients treated in an adult setting, see the NCCN Guidelines for ALL for additional risk stratification recommendations (available at NCCN.org).\n\n### Treatment Considerations: Phases and Agents\n\nThe treatment approach to ALL represents one of the most complex and intensive programs in cancer therapy. Although the specific treatment regimens and selection of drugs, dose schedules, and treatment durations differ among pediatric, AYA, and adult patients, and among different subtypes of ALL, the basic treatment principles are similar. In general, the treatment phases can be largely grouped into induction, consolidation, and maintenance. All treatment regimens for ALL include CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment. Some treatment plans may involve targeted agents and hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\n#### Induction\n\nRemission induction is the first block of chemotherapy with the intent of reducing tumor burden by clearing as many leukemic cells as possible from the bone marrow.95 Induction regimens are typically based on a backbone that includes a combination of vincristine, corticosteroids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone), and L-asparaginase/pegaspargase with or without anthracyclines (eg, daunorubicin, doxorubicin).87,95–97\n\nThe BFM/COG regimens are mainly based on a 4-drug induction regimen that includes a combination of vincristine, an anthracycline, a corticosteroid, and L-asparaginase.93,98–101 In the COG, NCI standard risk patients are treated with a 3-drug induction that does not include anthracyclines. Some studies from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) have used a 5-drug regimen in AYA and adult patients, which adds cyclophosphamide to the above 4-drug combination.102\n\nRandomized studies comparing the use of dexamethasone versus prednisone as part of induction therapy in children with ALL showed that dexamethasone significantly decreased the risk of isolated CNS relapse and improved EFS outcomes compared with prednisone.103,104 The observed advantage in outcomes with dexamethasone may partly be attributed to improved penetration of\n\n![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\ndexamethasone into the CNS.105 Although dexamethasone is reported to significantly reduce the risks for CNS relapse and improve EFS rates compared with prednisone, significant toxicities are associated with dexamethasone including osteonecrosis and infection,106,107 and an advantage for OS has yet to be conclusively shown, except in the subset of T-ALL patients with prednisone good response in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study.106\n\nSeveral different agents exist for asparaginase depletion, including pegaspargase, Erwinia asparaginase, and calaspargase pegol. Compared with native Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase, pegaspargase has a longer half-life and decreased immunogenicity.95,108 Erwinia asparaginase is typically given to patients who have experienced an allergic reaction to pegaspargase, and it requires a more frequent administration schedule.95 Calaspargase pegol is a newer asparaginase enzyme formulation with a different linker molecule that enhances its hydrolytic stability and increases its half-life relative to pegaspargase.109\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nThe intent of postinduction consolidation is to eliminate any leukemic cells potentially remaining after induction therapy, further eradicating residual disease. The consolidation phase is the treatment phase most affected by risk stratification, such that lower-risk patients receive less-intensive consolidation and higher-risk patients receive consolidation that is more intensive. The postremission induction phase of treatment (but before long-term maintenance therapy) may also be described as intensification therapy. The combination of drugs and duration of therapy for consolidation regimens vary largely among studies and patient populations but can comprise combinations of drugs similar to those used during the induction phase. High-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), cyclophosphamide, thioguanine, vincristine, corticosteroids, and L-asparaginase/pegaspargase are frequently incorporated into consolidation/intensification regimens.87,95,97,100,101 This phase of treatment may involve 4 to 6 cycles of therapy and in some settings, may occur over a duration of up to 8 months.87\n\n#### Maintenance\n\nThe goal of extended maintenance or continuation therapy is to prevent disease relapse after postremission induction and consolidation therapy. Most maintenance regimens are based on a backbone of daily 6-MP and weekly methotrexate (typically with the addition of periodic vincristine and corticosteroids) for 2 to 3 years.87,95,97 Factors that affect the bioavailability of 6-MP can significantly impact patient care. Oral 6-MP can have highly variable drug and metabolite concentrations among patients.110,111 Furthermore, age, gender, and genetic polymorphisms can affect bioavailability.112–114 The efficacy of maintenance therapy is determined by the metabolism of 6-MP to the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent 6-thioguanine nucleotide; however, other pathways compete for 6-MP, thereby reducing the amount of active metabolite produced. The 4 enzymes that metabolize 6-MP are xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, TPMT, and NUDT15. Heterozygosity at the TPMT gene locus occurs in 5%–10% of the population and has been shown to have intermediate enzyme activity.115–117 NUDT15 deficiency is also associated with 6-MP intolerance. Therefore, determining a patient's TPMT and NUDT15 genotype is recommended to optimize 6-MP dosing, especially in patients who experience myelosuppression at standard doses.118 For dosing guidelines for thiopurines based on TPMT and NUDT15 phenotype, see \"Pharmacogenomics\" in the full version of the algorithm (at NCCN.org).\n\nNoncompliance also results in undertreatment, particularly in the AYA population. Compliance issues should be addressed for patients without cytopenia. If increasing doses of 6-MP are given during maintenance but no drop in the counts is observed, this may be indicative of noncompliance.119 Quantification of 6-MP metabolites can be very useful in determining whether the lack of myelosuppression is due to noncompliance or hypermetabolism.\n\n## Extramedullary Disease Prophylaxis and Treatment\n\nThe goal of CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment is to prevent CNS disease or relapse by clearing leukemic cells within sites that cannot be readily accessed with systemic chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier. CNS-directed therapy may include intrathecal therapy (ie, intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, corticosteroid), cranial irradiation, and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, intermediate-/ high-dose cytarabine, L-asparaginase).87,95,97,105,120 CNS prophylaxis is typically given to all patients throughout the entire course of ALL therapy, from induction, to consolidation, to the maintenance phases of treatment. Patients with testicular disease at diagnosis that is not resolved by the end of induction therapy may receive radiation to the testes.\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nAllogeneic HSCT has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with ALL with evidence of certain high-risk features and/or persistent disease.87,121,122 In addition, survival rates appear to be comparable regardless of the stem cell source (matched related, matched unrelated, cord blood, or haploidentical donor).122,123 The benefit of allogeneic HSCT in infants with ALL is controversial, although some studies have shown a role in high-risk patients with KMT2A rearrangements and other poor risk factors.87,124,125 Based on the data, it is reasonable to consider HSCT in first remission (CR1) for certain patients as described in the HSCT sections throughout the discussion.\n\n# Targeted Agents\n\nThe emergence of targeted therapies for hematologic malignancies, including the treatment of Ph-positive disorders with TKIs, represents an important advancement in ALL therapy.126–130 Clinicians should be aware of variation among the TKIs relating to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, histamine-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can affect the bioavailability of some TKIs. In Ph-like ALL cases harboring CRLF2 and JAK alterations, the utility of Janus kinases inhibitors are being explored.131 The purine nucleoside analog nelarabine has been approved for the treatment of R/R T-ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma.132 Monoclonal antibodies to surface antigens such as CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD52 have been used in unconjugated form (eg, rituximab, epratuzumab), conjugated to immunotoxins or chemotherapeutic agents (moxetumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin [InO]), or in the form of a bispecific antibody (blinatumomab).87,133–135 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that target CD19 have demonstrated durable remissions in pediatric and AYA patients with R/R B-ALL.136 Overall, these agents may be incorporated as part of frontline induction, consolidation, and/or maintenance regimens during the course of initial ALL therapy, and in R/R disease settings.\n\n# Management of Ph-Negative or Ph-Like B-ALL\n\n# Front-line Management of Patients With Ph-Negative or Ph-Like ALL\n\nThe management of de novo Ph-negative and Ph-like B-ALL is complex, and current regimens are based on a number of recently completed or ongoing trials referenced in the algorithm, which are summarized in the next sections.\n\n# COG AALL0331 and AALL0932\n\nThe COG AALL0331 trial helped establish the benefit of intensifying therapy for patients with EOI MRD .0.01%, which is now part of all COG protocols. This trial enrolled 5,311 patients with standard-risk B-ALL and used a 3-drug induction without anthracyclines (ie, dexamethasone, vincristine, and pegaspargase), with postinduction assignment into refined risk groups based on genetics and early response (ie, standard-risk low, standard-risk average, and standard-risk high).137 At the EOI, patients were randomized to receive standard consolidation (6-MP, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate) versus intensified consolidation (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-MP, vincristine, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate).137 For standard-risk low patients (ie, leukemic blasts were positive for triple trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 or were positive for ETV6-RUNX1 plus day 8 [or day 15] M1 bone marrow and day 29 MRD ,0.1%), the 5-year EFS and OS rates were 95% and 99%, respectively. The 5-year EFS and OS for all evaluable patients with standard risk disease was 89% and 96%, respectively, and intensified consolidation did not significantly improve outcomes for standard-risk average patients.137 Standard-risk high patients (day 15 bone marrow",

The 5-year DFS estimates for average risk patients who received oral methotrexate 20 mg/m2 /dose versus 40 mg/m2 /dose were similar (95% 6 2.4% vs 92.3% 6 2.9%; P5.95), suggesting that escalation of the methotrexate starting dose does not improve outcomes.139 The 5-year DFS (6standard error) for the average risk patients randomized to receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks was 94.1% 6 1.0% vs 95.1% 6 0.9% (one-sided P5.86).138\n\n#### COG AALL0232 and AALL1131\n\nThe AALL0232 trial enrolled 2,154 patients between the ages of 1 and 30 years who were diagnosed with high-risk B-cell ALL.140 In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone versus prednisone during induction and HD-MTX versus C-MTX plus pegaspargase during IM1. HD-MTX showed improved 5-year EFS (80% vs 75%; P5.008) and OS (88.9% 6 1.2% vs 86.1% 6 1.4%; P5.25) rates compared with C-MTX. No statistically significant difference was reported in the occurrence of mucositis, neurotoxicity, osteonecrosis, or other toxicities. The ALL0232 trial compared dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 /day for 14 days to prednisone 60 mg/m2 /day for 28 days. Dexamethasone showed improved outcomes\n\nduring induction in patients younger than 10 years of age; however, it was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis in patients 10 years of age or older. These data suggest that age may be an important factor for the selection of a corticosteroid.140\n\nRelative to pediatric patients with standard risk B-ALL, patients with high-risk B-ALL experience high relapse rates and worse clinical outcomes.128,141 Some approaches to combat this are investigating the integration of new agents into treatment after induction. The COG AALL1131 study was a phase III trial for patients aged 1–30 years with newly diagnosed high-risk B-ALL.142,143 Patients enrolled on this trial received a standard 4-drug induction (dexamethasone/prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and pegaspargase). One experimental arm of this study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide as part of multiagent chemotherapy.143 However, infectious toxicities precipitated the closure of this study arm. Another experimental arm investigated whether substituting postinduction chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine) with cyclophosphamide and etoposide would improve the 4-year DFS of pediatric patients with very high risk B-ALL.142 This substitution was not superior to the control arm. Given this experience, future therapeutic approaches will examine the utility of targeted agents. In this context, the COG has investigated the incorporation of dasatinib for newly diagnosed high-risk patients with Ph-like B-ALL harboring ABL-class lesions (AALL1131),59 and is investigating ruxolitinib for high-risk patients with newly diagnosed Ph-like ALL harboring CRLF2 rearrangements and/or a mutation that activates JAK-STAT pathway (AALL1521).144 In addition, ongoing trials are investigating whether the combination of immunotherapies with chemotherapy improves outcomes in certain subsets of patients (blinatumomab in standard-risk B-ALL: COG AALL1731; inotuzumab ozogamicin in high-risk B-ALL: COG AALL1732).\n\n#### DFCI ALL Protocols 05-001 and 16-001\n\nThe DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 enrolled 678 children and adolescent patients (aged 1–18 years of age) with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B-ALL, and tested a new risk stratification system.78 At study entry, patients were classified as standard risk or high risk and a 4-drug induction was used (prednisone, vincristine, doxorubicin, and pegaspargase).78 After achieving complete remission, patients with high EOI MRD (",

Of 498 patients, 492 (98.8%) entered complete remission (low risk, 99.6%; standard risk, 99.5%; and high risk, 90.4%). The 5-year EFS and OS estimates were 85.6% and 93.5%, resepectively.88 This study demonstrated that prophylactic cranial irradiation could be omitted without compromising OS.\n\nThe ongoing Total XVII Study will incorporate novel precision medicine strategies based on genomic features and targeted treatment.74 Some of these approaches include the use of NGS-based diagnostics. In addition, the Total XVII study will investigate the use of dasatinib in patients with ABL-class chimeric fusions identified by RNA sequencing, and ruxolitinib in patients with alterations that activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.74\n\n# Blinatumomab\n\nBlinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that directs CD3-positive effector memory T cells to CD19-positive target cells, inducing cell death.145,146 Blinatumomab first showed promising clinical efficacy as a means of eradicating persistent MRD after upfront chemotherapy. In a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study, Topp et al135 evaluated the efficacy of blinatumomab in MRD-positive patients with Ph-negative B-ALL (n521; age range, 20–77 years).

In addition, blinatumomab requires prolonged exposure for efficacy due to a short half-life (mean 6 standard deviation [SD]) of 1.2560.63 hours.178,179 The most significant toxicities noted in clinical studies are CNS events and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Neurologic toxicities have been reported in 50% of patients (median onset, 7 days) and grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicities, including encephalopathy, convulsions, and disorientation, have occurred in 15% of patients.178 CRS typically occurs within the first 2 days after start of blinatumomab infusion.178 Symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased transaminases, and increased total bilirubin. The incidence of adverse events can be reduced with monitoring for early intervention at onset of symptoms. However, the serious nature of these events underscores the importance of receiving treatment in a specialized cancer center that has experience with blinatumomab.\n\n# CAR T Cells\n\nOne of the early treatments for patients with advanced ALL included adoptive cell therapy to induce a graft-versusleukemia effect through allogeneic HSCT or donor lymphocyte infusions. However, this method resulted in a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease. To circumvent this issue, current advances are focused on the use of the patient's own T cells to target the B-ALL cells. The generation of CAR T cells to treat B-ALL is a significant advancement in the field.136,180–182 The treatment of patients with CAR T cells has served as a bridge for transplant, enabling patients who were formerly unable to receive a transplant due to poor remission status to achieve a CR and ultimately transplantation. It is also reported that patients who received CAR T cells can maintain longterm remission without subsequent HSCT.136 CAR T cell therapy relies on the genetic manipulation of a patients' T cells to generate a response against a leukemic cellsurface antigen, most commonly CD19.183 Briefly, T cells from the patient are harvested and engineered with a receptor that targets a cell surface tumor-specific antigen (eg, CD19 antigen on the surface of leukemic cells). The ability of CAR T cells to be reprogrammed to target any cell-surface antigen on leukemic cells is advantageous and avoids the issue of tumor evasion of the immune system via receptor downregulation, and studies of CAR T cells targeting antigens other than CD19 are ongoing.183 The manufacture of CAR T cells currently requires ex vivo viral transduction, activation, and expansion over several days to weeks to produce a sufficient cell number to engender disease response.184 Following infusion, debulking of tumors occurs in less than a week and these CAR T cells may remain in the body for extended periods of time to provide immunosurveillance against relapse.\n\nThere are several clinical trials using CAR T cells that differ in the receptor construct for patients with R/R ALL. A modified receptor, termed 19-28z—which links the CD19 binding receptor to the costimulatory protein CD28—demonstrated an overall CR in 14 of 16 patients with R/R B-cell ALL following infusion with CAR T cells.185 In addition, 7 of 16 patients were able to receive an allogeneic HSCT, suggesting that CAR T cells may provide a bridge to transplant.185 No relapse was observed in patients who had allogeneic HSCT (follow-up, 2–24 months); however, 2 deaths occurred from transplant complications. Follow-up data of adult patients enrolled on this trial (n553) showed an 83% CR rate after the infusion and 32 patients achieved an MRD-negative CR.186 At a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 1–65), the median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 8.7–23.4 months).186 KTE-C19 uses a similar anti-CD19 CAR construct and demonstrated an MRD-negative CR in 6 of 8 efficacy-evaluable adult patients with R/R ALL.187\n\nA second receptor construct defined by the attachment of an alternative costimulatory protein, 4-1BB, to the CD19 binding protein has shown similar results to the 19-28z CAR T cells in terms of overall CR.188 These cells, more simply referred to as CTL019, were infused into 16 children and 4 adults with R/R ALL; a CR after therapy was achieved in 14 patients.188 There was no response of the disease to treatment in 3 patients and disease response to therapy was still under evaluation for 3 patients.188 A follow-up study of 25 children and 5 adults showed a morphologic CR in 90% (27 of 30) of patients within a month of treatment and an OS of 78% (95% CI, 65%–95%) and EFS of 78% (95% CI, 51%–88%) at 6 months.189 There were 19 patients in sustained remission, 15 of whom received no further therapy. The ELIANA trial of CTL019/tisagenlecleucel in 75 children and young adults with R/R B-ALL demonstrated an overall remission rate of 81% within 3 months of infusion, all of which were notably MRD negative.136 This high response rate was associated with OS rates of 90% and 76% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. As with blinatumomab, T-cell activation was accompanied by severe CRS and neurologic toxicity, as well as higher infectious risks—though treatment-related mortality remains low.136 Given these data, CTL019/tisagenlecleucel was recommended for accelerated approval by the FDA oncologic drug advisory committee in July 2017 and fully approved by the FDA in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to age 25 years (aged ,26 years) with R/R precursor B-cell ALL.\n\nThe side effect profile of CAR T cells differs substantially from those observed with standard therapies (ie, chemotherapy, HSCT). Although side effects from CAR T cells may be severe, they have been reversible. Adverse events are attributed to CRS and macrophage activation that occur in direct response to adoptive cell transplant, resulting in high fever, hypotension, breathing difficulties, delirium, aphasia, and neurologic complications. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptor and antagonist of interleukin-6, and corticosteroids are the main options used to manage CRS and neurotoxicity symptoms.190,191 Several groups have developed comprehensive guidelines regarding grading systems for and management of CAR T-cell–associated toxicities.192,193\n\n#### Inotuzumab Ozogamicin\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is a calicheamicin-based antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22. Following the generation of encouraging single-agent phase II data,194 a randomized study was conducted comparing InO with standard intensive chemotherapy regimens in Ph-negative or Ph-positive ALL in first or second relapse, defined as .5% marrow blasts (n5326). Compared with standard therapy, InO produced a significantly higher CR/CRi rate (80.7% vs 29.4%; P,.001), and higher MRD-negative rates (78.4% vs 28.1%; P,.001).195 Notably, responses were consistent across most subgroups, including those with high marrow burden, and those with Ph-positive leukemia. The overall incidence of severe adverse events was similar across treatment arms, with a higher incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease observed in the inotuzumab group, related in part to dual alkylator-based transplant conditioning administered in remission. These data translated into a significant benefit in the median duration of remission (4.6 vs 3.1 months; P5.03), median PFS (5 vs 1.8 months; P,.001), and mean OS (13.9 vs 9.9 months; P5.005).195 In August 2017, InO received full approval from the FDA for the treatment of adults with R/R precursor B-cell ALL.\n\nHowever, pediatric experience with InO is limited. In a retrospective study of pediatric patients with R/R B-ALL (n551) who received InO in a compassionate use program, 67% of patients achieved CR and a majority of the responders were MRD-negative (71%).196 None of the patients developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during therapy, but 52% of patients who underwent HSCT following InO (11 of 21; 52%) developed SOS.196\n\n#### Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nFor patients with early relapse of B-ALL, HSCT is the only currently established curative modality. The CIBMTR group conducted an analysis of outcomes of patients with ALL (n5582; median age, 29 years; range, ,1–60 years) who underwent transplant during relapse.197 At 3 years, OS rates were 16% (95% CI, 13%–20%).197 Based on findings from evidence-based review of the published literature, the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy guidelines recommend HSCT for pediatric patients with ALL in CR2 after experiencing an early marrow relapse.198\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Ph-Negative or Ph-Like ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are initially grouped according to risk criteria (see PEDALL-3, page 85), and induction therapy consists of multiagent chemotherapy. Patients who are MRD negative after induction will continue risk-stratified therapy. Patients who are MRD positive after induction may undergo intensified consolidation therapy. If MRD remains persistent, other options include blinatumomab or tisagenlecleucel (category 2B recommendation). In all cases, HSCT may be considered as part of consolidation or maintenance therapy (see PEDALL-4, page 86).\n\nR/R Management For pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL experiencing early or late first relapse, the panel recommends initial treatment with systemic therapy (see PEDALL-9, page 91). If patients experience CR (CR2) and are MRD negative, the options are to continue on chemotherapy and receive maintenance therapy or HSCT if feasible based on the risk of subsequent relapse. If patients experience CR2 and are MRD positive, or are experiencing first relapse after a prior HSCT, in addition to chemotherapy, blinatumomab, tisagenlecleucel, and inotuzumab ozogamicin may be considered prior to either a first or second HSCT. If patients experience less than a CR (ie, multiple relapse), treatment options include chemotherapy, blinatumomab, tisagenlecleucel, or InO, and they may receive HSCT as consolidation therapy if their disease subsequently responds to therapy (see PEDALL-11, page 93). Long-term remissions have been also reported after tisagenlecleucel treatment without subsequent HSCT.136 If the disease does not respond to therapy, alternative treatment options may be considered with best supportive and palliative care (PEDALL-11, page 93).\n\n# Management of Ph-Positive B-ALL\n\nPh-positive ALL is relatively rare in pediatric patients, and the development of TKIs has improved previously poor treatment outcomes.54 The management of Ph-positive B-ALL as outlined in this discussion based on a number of clinical trials referenced in the algorithm, which are summarized below.\n\n# Front-line Management of Patients With Ph-Positive ALL\n\n# COG AALL0031 and AALL0622\n\nIn a multicenter study (COG AALL0031), children and adolescents with Ph-positive ALL (n592; aged 1–21 years) were treated with an intensive chemotherapy regimen combined with imatinib (340 mg/m2 /day; given during postremission induction therapy and maintenance).128 Among the cohort (n544) who received continuous imatinib exposure (280 consecutive days before maintenance initiation), the 3-year EFS rate was 80.5% (95% CI, 64.5%–89.8%). This outcome compared favorably with that of a historical population of patients with Ph-positive ALL (n5120) treated on a POG protocol, which showed a 3-year EFS rate of only 35% (P,.0001).128 Moreover, the 3-year EFS rates were similar among the groups of patients who received chemotherapy combined with continuous imatinib (88%; n525) or allogeneic HSCT from a related donor (57%; n521) or unrelated donor [URD] (72%; n511). No major toxicities were found to be associated with the addition of imatinib to the intensive chemotherapy regimen.128 Subsequent follow-up after 5 years confirmed these outcomes.129 In a phase II single-arm trial (COG AALL0622) of children and young adults with Ph-positive ALL (n560; aged 1–30 years), imatinib was replaced with dasatinib on induction day 15 and combined with the same chemotherapy used in COG AALL0031.130 The 5-year OS and EFS rates (6SD) were 86% 6 5% and 60% 6 7%, respectively, and outcomes were similar to those observed in COG AALL0031.130\n\n#### EsPhALL\n\nThe European intergroup study of postinduction treatment of Ph-chromosome positive ALL (EsPhALL) reported results of the randomized open-label trial designed to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of discontinuous postinduction imatinib plus chemotherapy with the BFM backbone intensive treatment versus chemotherapy alone.127 The study enrolled 108 good-risk and 70 poor-risk patients aged 1 year to 18 years. Good-risk patients were randomized 1:1 and poor-risk patients were all assigned to receive chemotherapy plus imatinib. There was a trend toward improved 4-year DFS for good-risk patients who received imatinib plus chemotherapy versus those who received chemotherapy alone (72.9% vs 61.7%; P5.24). In the as-treated analysis, good-risk patients who received imatinib with chemotherapy had a 4-year EFS of 75.2% versus 55.9% in patients who did not receive imatinib (P5.06). The incidence of serious adverse events was not statically different between the 2 groups (P5.64).127 Enrollment in this trial was stopped in 2009 following results of the COG AALL0031 study that demonstrated a benefit of continuous imatinib. The EsPhALL study was amended into a single-arm study to add continuous imatinib on induction day 15, with 97% of patients achieving first CR.126 However, the 5-year EFS and OS rates (57% and 71.8%, respectively) were similar in cohorts that received discontinuous postinduction imatinib and continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy with the BFM backbone intensive treatment.126,127 Additionally, a phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding continuous dasatinib at day 15 to the intensive BFM regimen in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (n5109 enrolled; age range, 1–17 years).199 The efficacy analysis included 104 patients, who all achieved CR; 15 of the patients received allogeneic HSCT in CR1. An interim analysis showed a 3-year EFS of 66.0% (95% CI, 54.8%–75.0%) and a 3-year OS of 92.3% (95% CI, 85.2%–96.1).199\n\n# St. Jude Total Therapy XV–XVII Studies\n\nIn the Total XVI study from the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Jeha et al sought to compare the response rates and overall clinical outcome of pediatric patients with Ph-positive ALL treated in the pre-TKI era versus with the current approach of incorporating a TKI.200 Patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL (n51035; age range, 1–18 years) were treated on low- and standard-/ high-risk arms, including 30 patients with Ph-positive ALL.200 The TKIs, imatinib or dasatinib were administered continuously through all phases of treatment starting on days 22 through 26 of remission induction therapy, and resulted in significant reductions in MRD when compared with the pre-TKI cohort that received chemotherapy alone (P,.001).200 The 5-year EFS for the TKI versus pre-TKI groups was 68.6619.2% and 31.669.9%, respectively (P5.022).200 In the Total XVII study, dasatinib will be given to patients with Ph-positive ALL and patients with ABL-class chimeric fusions (ie, involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRA, or PDGFRB) identified by RNA-Seq.74 In this setting, dasatinib will be given on day 15 of remission induction.74\n\n#### Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nA retrospective analysis by Arico et al ` 201 reported significant improvement in 5-year DFS and OS for pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-positive ALL in CR1 who received HSCT, including matched related donor, matched URD, or mismatched related donor allogeneic SCT or autologous SCT, versus those who received chemotherapy alone without TKIs.198 In the large, international, collaborative MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 trial conducted in patients with previously untreated ALL, the subgroup with Ph-positive disease (n5267; median age, 40 years; range, 15–60 years) was eligible for allogeneic HSCT if patients were younger than 50 (in the ECOG E2993 trial) or 55 (in the MRC UKALL XII trial) years of age and had a matched sibling or matched URD.202 Among the Ph-positive patient cohort, postremission treatment included matched sibling allogeneic HSCT (n545), matched URD allogeneic HSCT (n531), and chemotherapy alone (n586). The 5-year OS rate according to postremission therapy was 44%, 36%, and 19%, respectively, and the 5-year EFS rate was 41%, 36%, and 9%, respectively.202 Both the OS and EFS outcomes for patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT (related or unrelated) were significantly improved compared with those who received only chemotherapy. The incidence of transplantrelated mortality was 27% with matched sibling allogeneic HSCT and 39% with matched URD HSCT. An intent-totreat analysis of patients with a matched sibling donor versus those without a matched sibling donor showed no statistically significant difference in 5-year OS rates (34% vs 25%, respectively).202\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the COG AALL0031 trial reported similar 3-year EFS rates among very high-risk patients with Ph-positive ALL in CR1 who received imatinib with intensive chemotherapy followed by HSCT or those who received chemotherapy with imatinib maintenance without HSCT.128,129,198\n\n# Management of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ph-Positive ALL\n\nAs previously mentioned, the outcomes of pediatric patients with R/R B-ALL has been historically poor. In Ph-positive ALL, several mechanisms may contribute to this including the development of resistance to TKIs.54 Several trials referenced in the algorithm have developed regimens that are currently used to treat R/R Ph-positive B-ALL, and these studies are summarized subsequently.\n\n# Chemotherapy and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\n\nIn a phase I study, the efficacy and toxicity of imatinib was evaluated in pediatric patients with R/R Ph-positive leukemia, including cases of ALL, AML, and chronic myeloid leukemia (n531).203 In this study, imatinib demonstrated a good toxicity profile and was well tolerated at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m2 /day. Among patients with ALL evaluable for morphologic response (n510), 7 achieved an M1 and 1 achieved an M2 bone marrow.203 In the COG AALL0031 study, pediatric patients with Ph-positive ALL who relapsed after initial treatment with imatinib and chemotherapy were able to achieve an overall CR2 rate of 67% (n520/30).129 Of the patients who attained CR2, 85% (n517/20) remained in remission for at least 3 months.129\n\n# Blinatumomab\n\nAn open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in adult patients (aged",

The median DFS and OS were both 20 weeks and the 1-year OS rate was 28%. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was common, but only one case of grade 4 CNS toxicity (reversible) was observed.212\n\nIn a phase I trial, NECTAR, the efficacy and safety of nelarabine in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide was evaluated in children with R/R T-ALL or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (n519).213 Of evaluable patients with R/R T-ALL (n59), a 44% response rate was observed.213\n\n# Bortezomib-Based Regimens\n\nThe referenced study, COG AALL07P1, evaluating a bortezomib-containing regimen included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.163 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# UKALL R3\n\nThe referenced study, UKALL R3, evaluating the effect of mitoxantrone in multiple risk-stratified chemotherapy blocks included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.157,159 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# ALL-REZ BFM 90\n\nThe referenced study, ALL-REZ BFM 90, evaluating riskstratified multichemotherapy blocks, included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.160 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nHSCT is the only curative treatment of R/R T-ALL, but this requires successful remission induction and the data are limited.83 In the COG AALL01P2 study, most patients with T-ALL (n55 of 7) did not experience CR2.161 In the MRC UKALL R1 trial, compared with chemotherapy alone, allogeneic HSCT did not significantly improve EFS in pediatric patients with R/R ALL.214\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for T-ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that pediatric and AYA patients with T-ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are treated with chemotherapy (see PEDALL-6, page 88). After a response assessment, standard- or high-risk patients continue consolidation chemotherapy. The features that define standard risk in this context are: day 29 MRD ,0.01%, CNS-1, absence of testicular disease, and no steroid pretreatment. Very-high-risk patients have end of consolidation MRD .0.1%. High-risk patients in this context do not exhibit any standard- or very high risk factors. Patients who have very high risk features may continue chemotherapy or pursue alternative therapy and consider HSCT as part of consolidation therapy. However, it is recommended that additional therapy be given to achieve MRD negativity before HSCT.\n\nR/R Management For pediatric and AYA patients with T-ALL experiencing first relapse, the panel recommends initial treatment with clinical trial or chemotherapy (see PEDALL-10, page 92). If patients experience CR2, consolidation therapy with chemotherapy should be continued with HSCT. If patients experience less than CR (ie, multiple relapse), treatment options include chemotherapy, and patients may receive HSCT as consolidation therapy if they subsequently respond to therapy (see PEDALL-11, page 93). If the disease does not respond to therapy, alternative treatment options may be considered with best supportive and palliative care (see PEDALL-11, page 93).\n\n# Management of Infant ALL\n\nMost infant patients with ALL present with aggressive features, including high WBC counts, CNS involvement, and leukemia cutis, necessitating the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens.34 However, infant patients are especially vulnerable to treatment-related toxicities, so clinical trials are continually investigating novel strategies to reduce this.34 Based on trials referenced in the algorithm, the management of infant ALL is summarized in subsequent sections.\n\n# Front-line Management of Infants With ALL\n\n# Interfant-99\n\nIn a multicenter Interfant-99 trial, 482 infant patients with ALL, aged 0 to 12 months, were risk-stratified according to peripheral blood response to a 7-day prednisone prophase, and treated with a hybrid protocol that incorporated elements of standard ALL and AML regimens.36 Response was defined as good, and risk as standard, if the blast count in peripheral blood at day 8 was ,1000 cells/ml.

Patients in the medium- and high-risk groups were randomly assigned to receive a lymphoid consolidation course (low-dose cytarabine, 6-MP, and cyclophosphamide [IB]) or experimental myeloid courses (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide [ADE]; and mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and etoposide [MAE]). The 6-year EFS and OS probabilities of all patients were 46.1% and 58.2%, respectively.9 The 6-year probability of DFS was comparable for the randomized arms (ADE1MAE 39.3% vs IB 36.8%; log-rank P5.47).9\n\n# COG AALL0631\n\nBased on data showing aberrant activation of FLT3 pathway in infant ALL with KMT2A rearrangements,217–219 the COG AALL0631 trial was designed to evaluate whether the addition of a FLT3 TKI, lestaurtinib, to postinduction chemotherapy would increase treatment efficacy in infants with newly diagnosed ALL.34,220 Initial induction consisted of 3 weeks of therapy based on a COG P9407 backbone (cohort 1).220,221 Differences between the revised COG P9407 induction and the AALL0631 induction included use of low-dose cytarabine instead of cyclophosphamide, decreased daunorubicin dose and substitution of native L-asparaginase with pegaspargase.220 Due to excessive induction toxicity, the study was amended to include a modified 5-week Interfant-99 based induction and enhanced supportive care guidelines (cohort 2).220 Induction mortality and sterile site infections were significantly lower for patients in cohort 2, and higher complete response rates were observed at the endinduction intensification for cohort 2 (week 9, n594/100 [94%]) versus cohort 1 (week 7, n517/25 [68%]; P5.0012).220 The addition of lestaurtinib did not demonstrate a benefit in outcomes.34\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nThe benefit derived from using HSCT in infant leukemia is unclear.34 Several retrospective studies suggest no clinical advantage or a benefit at low EFS rates.222 In the Interfant-99 study, only a subgroup of infant patients with KMT2A-rearranged ALL and additional poor prognostic factors (age ,6 months, poor response to steroids at day 8, high WBC) appeared to benefit from HSCT in CR1 over chemotherapy alone.125\n\n## Management of Infant Patients With Relapsed or Refractory ALL\n\nInfant patients with R/R ALL have poor outcomes, and few studies have focused on this specific group.223,224 Studies summarized previously for B-ALL and T-ALL include some infant patients, and those management strategies apply in this context.\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Infant ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that infant patients with ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are treated with Interfant-based chemotherapy (see PEDALL-7, page 89). To ensure appropriate consolidation, it is important to assess the KMT2A status of the disease. If the patient is standard-risk (ie, KMT2A not rearranged), after a response assessment, the patient may be treated with Interfant-based consolidation. Alternatively, patients who are MRD negative after induction will continue risk-stratified chemotherapy similar to what has been described for Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL. Patients who are MRD positive after induction may undergo intensified consolidation therapy. In all cases, HSCT may be considered as part of consolidation or maintenance therapy (see PEDALL-7, page 89).\n\nIf the patient has KMT2A rearranged, he or she is treated with an intensive Interfant-based consolidation chemotherapy.

Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma generally benefit from treatment with ALL-like regimens versus traditional lymphoma therapy18,19 and should be treated in a center that has experience with lymphoblastic lymphoma.\n\nHematopathology evaluations should include morphologic examination of malignant lymphocytes using Wright-Giemsa–stained slides and hematoxylin and eosin–stained core biopsy and clot sections; comprehensive immunophenotyping with flow cytometry (see the full version of the discussion section in these guidelines for more details on immunophenotyping); and baseline characterization of leukemic clone(s)—by flow cytometry, or identification of clonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements—to facilitate subsequent analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD).\n\n# Genetic Abnormalities and Molecular Subtypes\n\nIdentification of specific recurrent genetic abnormalities is critical for disease evaluation, optimal risk stratification, and treatment planning. Subtypes of B-ALL with recurrent genetic abnormalities include the following: hyperdiploidy (51–67 chromosomes); hypodiploidy (,44 chromosomes); t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), BCR-ABL1; t(v;11q23.3), KMT2A rearranged; t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1), ETV6-RUNX1; t(1;19)(q23;p13.3), TCF3-PBX1; and t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.1), IL3-IGH. 20 During the 2016 WHO classification update, 2 new provisional entities were added to the B-ALL classification: B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with translocations involving tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptors (BCR-ABL1–like ALL or Ph-like ALL)21,22 and B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21).21,23 Two new provisional entities were also added to T-ALL: early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia and natural killer cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.21\n\nIn these guidelines, the NCCN Panel for Pediatric ALL has delineated the features that are commonly associated\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nwith favorable or unfavorable outcomes in B-ALL (see \"Genetic Risk Groups for B-ALL,\" available in these guidelines at NCCN.org). A brief summary is also provided in this discussion for genetic features associated with T-ALL.\n\n#### Favorable Risk Features\n\nAmong children with ALL, the most common chromosomal abnormality is hyperdiploidy (.50 chromosomes) as seen in 25% of cases of B-ALL compared with 7% in the adult ALL patient population.24,25 The ETV6-RUNX1 subtype (also within the B-cell lineage) resulting from chromosomal translocation t(12;21) is also among the most commonly occurring subtypes in childhood ALL (25%) compared with adults (2%).24,25 Both hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 subtypes are associated with favorable outcomes in pediatric ALL,26 and occur less frequently among AYA patients compared with younger children.24\n\n#### Unfavorable Risk Features\n\nSeveral chromosomal abnormalities are well-recognized prognostic biomarkers of high-risk disease at all ages, including low hypodiploidy (30–39 chromosomes), near haploidy (,30 chromosomes), KMT2A (MLL) translocations, t(17;19)/TCF3-HLF fusion, and BCR-ABL1. 27 Hypodiploidy is associated with poor prognosis and is observed in 1%–2% of pediatric patients.28–30 Of note, low hypodiploidy is associated with a high frequency of TP53 alterations, which are germline in ;50% of cases.31,32\n\nChromosomal rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene, previously referred to as the human mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, occur in approximately 5% of pediatric ALL cases, with a higher incidence in infants (;70%–80%).33–36 These KMT2A rearrangements, including cases with t(4;11) translocation, are associated with poor outcomes, especially in infants.37,38 The translocation t(17;19)(q22;p13), resulting in the fusion gene TCF3-HLF, defines a rare subtype of pediatric ALL (,1%) and is associated with poor outcomes.39,40 Conversely, another translocation t(1;19) that results in the fusion gene TCF3-PBX1 occurs in approximately 5% of pediatric ALL cases and is associated with intermediate outcomes.39,41\n\nB-ALL with iAMP21 is characterized by amplification of a portion of chromosome 21, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe for the RUNX1 gene.42,43 Occurring in approximately 2% of children with ALL, B-ALL with iAMP21 is associated with adverse prognosis when treated with low-intensity regimens.42,43 Children with iAMP21 are typically older, with a median\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nage of 9 years, and have low platelet counts and low white blood cell (WBC) counts.44\n\nBCR-ABL1– or Ph-positive ALL is associated with poor prognosis and is relatively uncommon among childhood ALL (2%), whereas this subtype is more common among adults (25%).24,25 The frequency of Ph-positive ALL increases with age, and younger children (1–9 years) with Ph-positive ALL have a better prognosis than adolescents with this subtype.45,46\n\nIn B-ALL, mutations in the Ikaros gene (IKZF1) are seen in approximately 15%–20% of patients with pediatric B-ALL47,48 and at a higher frequency of .75% in patients who are also BCR-ABL1 positive.47,49 In many studies, IKZF1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis and a greater incidence of relapse.49,50 An analysis of the MRD-dependent prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletions with co-occurring deletions in CDKN2A, CDKN2B, PAX5, or PAR1 in the absence of ERG deletion conferred poor outcomes in pediatric patients with B-ALL.51 Emerging data suggests that an intragenic ERG deletion is associated with favorable outcomes in pediatric B-ALL, and in this context, co-occurring IKZF1 deletions do not affect prognosis.52,53\n\nBCR-ABL1–like or Ph-like ALL is a subgroup of B-ALL associated with unfavorable prognosis that occurs in approximately 15% of pediatric patients with ALL.22,54,55 A study using gene expression signatures to classify pediatric patients with ALL into subtypes estimated the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the BCR-ABL1–like ALL group to be 60%.22 In adult patients with BCR-ABL1–like ALL, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) is significantly lower (22.5%; 95% CI, 14.9%–29.3%) compared with patients with non–BCR-ABL1–like ALL (49.3%; 95% CI, 42.8%–56.2%).56 Although this subgroup is Ph-negative, they show an otherwise similar genetic profile to the Ph-positive ALL subgroup, including an IKZF1 mutation.49 A study evaluating the relationship between BCR-ABL1–like and IKZF1 in children with B-cell precursor ALL showed that 40% of cases had co-occurrence of these mutations.57 The presence of the BCR-ABL1-like signature and an IKZF1 deletion were indicative of poor prognosis independent of conventional risk factors.57 Genomically, the Ph-like subtype is typically associated with gene fusions and mutations that activate tyrosine kinase pathways as the common mechanism of transformation. These gene fusions and mutations include ABL-class rearrangements (ie, ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRA, PDGFRb, FGFR), JAK-STAT rearrangements and/or mutations (ie, CRLF2, 58 EPOR, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, SH2B3, IL7R) and other rearrangements in FLT3, NTRK3, LYN,\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nand, PTK2B genes.22,59,60 Genomic profiling studies have found that at least 80% of Ph-like ALL cases have cytokine receptor- or kinase-activating alterations, suggesting potential for ABL-class tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or JAK small molecule inhibitors to significantly improve patient outcomes in this subgroup.59–61\n\n#### Genetic Abnormalities Associated With T-ALL\n\nT-ALL is characterized by activating mutations of NOTCH1, and rearrangements of transcription factors TLX1 (HOX11), TLX3 (HOX11L2), LYL1, TAL1, and KMT2A. 55,62 More than 50% of T-ALL cases have activating NOTCH1 mutations, and approximately 10%–15% of T-ALL cases have mutations in the NOTCH1-targeting E3 ligase FBXW7, which leads to prolonged NOTCH1 activation.63–65 In patients with T-ALL, NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations have generally been associated with favorable prognosis and lower MRD levels.66–68 However, it is unclear if these mutations are independent predictors of outcome, or if there needs to be concurrent absence of RAS or PTEN mutations.69–71\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Genetic Characterization\n\nThe presence of recurrent genetic abnormalities should be evaluated using karyotyping of G-banded metaphase chromosomes (conventional cytogenetics), interphase FISH assays, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (see PEDALL-1, page 82). FISH probes and RT-PCR primers should include those capable of detecting major recurrent genetic abnormalities. RT-PCR should measure transcript sizes (ie, p190 vs p210) of BCR-ABL1 in B-ALL. If samples are ETV6-RUNX1– and BCR-ABL1–negative, testing for other gene fusions and mutations associated with Ph-like ALL is encouraged in some patients, and may aid in risk stratification. Recurrent gene fusions and mutations that activate tyrosine kinase pathways and are associated with Ph-like ALL include gene fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, or PDGFRB (gene fusions) and mutations involving CRLF2, FLT3, IL7R, SH2B3, JAK1, JAK3, and JAK2 (in combination with CRLF2 gene fusions).60,72 Low-density arrays,73 next-generation sequencing (NGS)–based assays, and multiplex RT-PCR are typically used to detect signature or cryptic rearrangements and mutations characteristic of Ph-like ALL. Additional FISH probes that may be useful to consider include centromeric probes for chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 to detect hyperdiploidy; CDKN2A at 9p21.3 to detect deletions; probes to detect cryptic t(X;14)(p22;q32)/t(Y;14)(p11;q32) IGH-CRLF2 rearrangements; and probes to detect cryptic JAK2 and\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nFGFR1 rearrangements.74 In cases of aneuploidy or failed karyotype, additional assessment may include a microarray comparative genomic hybridization.\n\n# Workup\n\nThe initial workup for patients with ALL should include a thorough medical history and physical examination along with laboratory and imaging studies, where applicable (See PEDALL-2, page 84). Laboratory studies include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets and differential, a blood chemistry profile, liver function tests, and disseminated intravascular coagulation panel (including measurements for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time). The blood chemistry panel should include a tumor lysis syndrome panel (including measurements for serum lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, potassium, phosphates, and calcium). Female patients should undergo pregnancy testing and all male patients should be evaluated for testicular involvement of disease, including a scrotal ultrasound as indicated; testicular involvement is rare in ALL (1%–2% of males), but is slightly more common in T-ALL than B-ALL. Fertility counseling and/or preservation options should be presented to all patients.\n\nAppropriate imaging studies should also be performed to detect meningeal disease, chloromas, or CNS bleeding for patients with major neurologic signs or symptoms at diagnosis. If neurologic symptoms are observed, a CT/MRI scan of the head with contrast is recommended. To rule out mediastinal masses, a chest X-ray is recommended. If lymphoblastic lymphoma is suspected, a whole body PET/CT scan is recommended. CNS involvement should be evaluated through lumbar puncture at timing that is consistent with the treatment protocol. Pediatric-inspired regimens typically include lumbar puncture and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy at the time of diagnostic workup. The NCCN Pediatric ALL Panel recommends that the first intrathecal therapy be performed at initial scheduled lumbar puncture unless directed by symptoms to perform earlier (see full version of these guidelines for \"NCCN Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment of Extramedullary Involvement,\" available online at NCCN.org).\n\nAll patients should be evaluated for opportunistic infections as appropriate. In addition, an echocardiogram or cardiac scan should be considered for all patients due to the use of anthracyclines as the backbone of nearly all treatment regimens. Assessment of cardiac function is particularly important for patients with prior cardiac\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\nhistory, prior anthracycline exposure, or clinical symptoms suggestive of cardiac dysfunction. To appropriately tailor doses of select components of chemotherapy, including thiopurines, and minimize adverse effects during treatment, pharmacogenomic testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleoside diphosphate– linked moiety X-type motif (nudix hydrolase 15, NUDT15) should be considered. For dosing guidelines for thiopurines based on TPMT and NUDT15 phenotype, see the \"Pharmacogenomics\" section (available online, in these guidelines, at NCCN.org).\n\nDuring the workup, it is important to consider the potential influence of any ALL predisposition syndromes. A growing number of germline mutations associated with ALL risk have been reported.75 Importantly, children with Down syndrome are at an increased risk for the development of ALL.76 For non-Down syndrome–related ALL, most patients do not have an identifiable leukemia predisposition syndrome. An exception is low-hypodiploid ALL, in which germline TP53 mutations are common and testing should be considered.\n\nIt should be noted that the recommendations included in the guidelines represent a minimum set of workup considerations and that other evaluations or testing may be needed based on clinical symptoms. Procurement of cells should be considered for purposes of future research (in accordance with institutional practices or policies).\n\n# Prognostic Factors and Risk Stratification\n\nVarious disease-related and patient-specific factors may have prognostic significance in patients with ALL. In particular, patient age, WBC count, immunophenotypic/ cytogenetic/genetic subtype, presence of CNS disease, and response to therapy have been identified as important factors in defining risk and assessing prognosis for both childhood and adult ALL.\n\nInitially, risk assessment for childhood ALL was individually determined primarily by the institution, complicating the interpretation of data. However, in 1993, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and Children's Cancer Group (CCG) established a common set of risk criteria.77 In this system, 2 risk groups were designated: standard risk and high risk. Standard risk was assigned to patients aged 1 to ,10 years and with a WBC count less than 503109 cells/L, whereas all other patients with ALL, including T-ALL (regardless of age or WBC count), were considered high risk.30\n\nDifferent cooperative groups have used a combination of clinical, biologic, and response variables to allocate patients into risk groups based on outcome.30,74,78\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nSome cooperative groups subdivide patients into 5 or more different risk groups that are used to tailor therapy. In B-ALL, patients with high-risk or very-high-risk disease have been found to have any of the following characteristics: t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (ie, Ph-positive ALL) and/or presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene; hypodiploidy (,44 chromosomes)79; BCR-ABL1–like or Ph-like ALL59; iAMP2142,80; patients younger than age 1 with KMT2A gene rearrangement,34,80 or failure to achieve remission with induction therapy.30 Conversely, criteria were refined for lower risk and included patients with hyperdiploidy, especially with simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17,30,81 and the t(12;21) chromosomal translocation (ETV6-RUNX1 subtype).82 The presence or absence of extramedullary disease and the early response to treatment (eg, MRD) also modified risk.\n\nRisk stratification of T-ALL has been challenging, because other than MRD measurements, the clinical variables used to classify risk in B-ALL, including age and WBC counts, are not independently prognostic in T-ALL.83 Although T-ALL is often categorized as high risk depending on the institution, newer treatment options have resulted in improved survival outcomes for these patients.83–86 Furthermore, the identification of genetic mutations and the use of targeted therapies may change the way T-ALL is treated and ultimately how these patients are assessed for risk.\n\nThe POG and CCG have since merged to form the Children's Oncology Group (COG), and subsequent risk assessment has produced additional risk factors to further refine therapy.80 In the United States, other groups have also developed standards for risk-stratified treatment approaches, including the St. Jude Consortium87–89 and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium.78,90,91 Initial risk stratification for these cooperative groups integrates the NCI criteria such that patients are classified as being low, standard, high, or very high risk (see \"Risk Stratification Definitions, Initial Risk Group Stratification,\" available online, in these guidelines, at NCCN.org). After induction remission therapy, each group applies additional risk-stratified criteria (see \"Risk Stratification Definitions, Post-Induction Therapy Risk Group Stratification,\" in the algorithm at NCCN.org). The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) Group categorizes risk based ¨ on several factors, including MRD, poor prednisone response, evidence of MLL/AF4, and hypodiploidy.92,93\n\n#### COG Approach\n\nIn the COG approach, patients with B-ALL are initially classified as standard risk (ie, aged 1 to ,10 years and WBC\n\n![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\ncount ,503109 cells/L) or high risk (ie, aged",

In addition, high EOI MRD and persistent MRD are features of high-risk and very-high-risk disease.\n\nFor AYA patients treated in an adult setting, see the NCCN Guidelines for ALL for additional risk stratification recommendations (available at NCCN.org).\n\n### Treatment Considerations: Phases and Agents\n\nThe treatment approach to ALL represents one of the most complex and intensive programs in cancer therapy. Although the specific treatment regimens and selection of drugs, dose schedules, and treatment durations differ among pediatric, AYA, and adult patients, and among different subtypes of ALL, the basic treatment principles are similar. In general, the treatment phases can be largely grouped into induction, consolidation, and maintenance. All treatment regimens for ALL include CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment. Some treatment plans may involve targeted agents and hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\n\n#### Induction\n\nRemission induction is the first block of chemotherapy with the intent of reducing tumor burden by clearing as many leukemic cells as possible from the bone marrow.95 Induction regimens are typically based on a backbone that includes a combination of vincristine, corticosteroids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone), and L-asparaginase/pegaspargase with or without anthracyclines (eg, daunorubicin, doxorubicin).87,95–97\n\nThe BFM/COG regimens are mainly based on a 4-drug induction regimen that includes a combination of vincristine, an anthracycline, a corticosteroid, and L-asparaginase.93,98–101 In the COG, NCI standard risk patients are treated with a 3-drug induction that does not include anthracyclines. Some studies from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) have used a 5-drug regimen in AYA and adult patients, which adds cyclophosphamide to the above 4-drug combination.102\n\nRandomized studies comparing the use of dexamethasone versus prednisone as part of induction therapy in children with ALL showed that dexamethasone significantly decreased the risk of isolated CNS relapse and improved EFS outcomes compared with prednisone.103,104 The observed advantage in outcomes with dexamethasone may partly be attributed to improved penetration of\n\n![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)\n\ndexamethasone into the CNS.105 Although dexamethasone is reported to significantly reduce the risks for CNS relapse and improve EFS rates compared with prednisone, significant toxicities are associated with dexamethasone including osteonecrosis and infection,106,107 and an advantage for OS has yet to be conclusively shown, except in the subset of T-ALL patients with prednisone good response in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study.106\n\nSeveral different agents exist for asparaginase depletion, including pegaspargase, Erwinia asparaginase, and calaspargase pegol. Compared with native Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase, pegaspargase has a longer half-life and decreased immunogenicity.95,108 Erwinia asparaginase is typically given to patients who have experienced an allergic reaction to pegaspargase, and it requires a more frequent administration schedule.95 Calaspargase pegol is a newer asparaginase enzyme formulation with a different linker molecule that enhances its hydrolytic stability and increases its half-life relative to pegaspargase.109\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nThe intent of postinduction consolidation is to eliminate any leukemic cells potentially remaining after induction therapy, further eradicating residual disease. The consolidation phase is the treatment phase most affected by risk stratification, such that lower-risk patients receive less-intensive consolidation and higher-risk patients receive consolidation that is more intensive. The postremission induction phase of treatment (but before long-term maintenance therapy) may also be described as intensification therapy. The combination of drugs and duration of therapy for consolidation regimens vary largely among studies and patient populations but can comprise combinations of drugs similar to those used during the induction phase. High-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), cyclophosphamide, thioguanine, vincristine, corticosteroids, and L-asparaginase/pegaspargase are frequently incorporated into consolidation/intensification regimens.87,95,97,100,101 This phase of treatment may involve 4 to 6 cycles of therapy and in some settings, may occur over a duration of up to 8 months.87\n\n#### Maintenance\n\nThe goal of extended maintenance or continuation therapy is to prevent disease relapse after postremission induction and consolidation therapy. Most maintenance regimens are based on a backbone of daily 6-MP and weekly methotrexate (typically with the addition of periodic vincristine and corticosteroids) for 2 to 3 years.87,95,97 Factors that affect the bioavailability of 6-MP can significantly impact patient care. Oral 6-MP can have highly variable drug and metabolite concentrations among patients.110,111 Furthermore, age, gender, and genetic polymorphisms can affect bioavailability.112–114 The efficacy of maintenance therapy is determined by the metabolism of 6-MP to the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent 6-thioguanine nucleotide; however, other pathways compete for 6-MP, thereby reducing the amount of active metabolite produced. The 4 enzymes that metabolize 6-MP are xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, TPMT, and NUDT15. Heterozygosity at the TPMT gene locus occurs in 5%–10% of the population and has been shown to have intermediate enzyme activity.115–117 NUDT15 deficiency is also associated with 6-MP intolerance. Therefore, determining a patient's TPMT and NUDT15 genotype is recommended to optimize 6-MP dosing, especially in patients who experience myelosuppression at standard doses.118 For dosing guidelines for thiopurines based on TPMT and NUDT15 phenotype, see \"Pharmacogenomics\" in the full version of the algorithm (at NCCN.org).\n\nNoncompliance also results in undertreatment, particularly in the AYA population. Compliance issues should be addressed for patients without cytopenia. If increasing doses of 6-MP are given during maintenance but no drop in the counts is observed, this may be indicative of noncompliance.119 Quantification of 6-MP metabolites can be very useful in determining whether the lack of myelosuppression is due to noncompliance or hypermetabolism.\n\n## Extramedullary Disease Prophylaxis and Treatment\n\nThe goal of CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment is to prevent CNS disease or relapse by clearing leukemic cells within sites that cannot be readily accessed with systemic chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier. CNS-directed therapy may include intrathecal therapy (ie, intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, corticosteroid), cranial irradiation, and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, intermediate-/ high-dose cytarabine, L-asparaginase).87,95,97,105,120 CNS prophylaxis is typically given to all patients throughout the entire course of ALL therapy, from induction, to consolidation, to the maintenance phases of treatment. Patients with testicular disease at diagnosis that is not resolved by the end of induction therapy may receive radiation to the testes.\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nAllogeneic HSCT has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with ALL with evidence of certain high-risk features and/or persistent disease.87,121,122 In addition, survival rates appear to be comparable regardless of the stem cell source (matched related, matched unrelated, cord blood, or haploidentical donor).122,123 The benefit of allogeneic HSCT in infants with ALL is controversial, although some studies have shown a role in high-risk patients with KMT2A rearrangements and other poor risk factors.87,124,125 Based on the data, it is reasonable to consider HSCT in first remission (CR1) for certain patients as described in the HSCT sections throughout the discussion.\n\n# Targeted Agents\n\nThe emergence of targeted therapies for hematologic malignancies, including the treatment of Ph-positive disorders with TKIs, represents an important advancement in ALL therapy.126–130 Clinicians should be aware of variation among the TKIs relating to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, histamine-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can affect the bioavailability of some TKIs. In Ph-like ALL cases harboring CRLF2 and JAK alterations, the utility of Janus kinases inhibitors are being explored.131 The purine nucleoside analog nelarabine has been approved for the treatment of R/R T-ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma.132 Monoclonal antibodies to surface antigens such as CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD52 have been used in unconjugated form (eg, rituximab, epratuzumab), conjugated to immunotoxins or chemotherapeutic agents (moxetumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin [InO]), or in the form of a bispecific antibody (blinatumomab).87,133–135 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that target CD19 have demonstrated durable remissions in pediatric and AYA patients with R/R B-ALL.136 Overall, these agents may be incorporated as part of frontline induction, consolidation, and/or maintenance regimens during the course of initial ALL therapy, and in R/R disease settings.\n\n# Management of Ph-Negative or Ph-Like B-ALL\n\n# Front-line Management of Patients With Ph-Negative or Ph-Like ALL\n\nThe management of de novo Ph-negative and Ph-like B-ALL is complex, and current regimens are based on a number of recently completed or ongoing trials referenced in the algorithm, which are summarized in the next sections.\n\n# COG AALL0331 and AALL0932\n\nThe COG AALL0331 trial helped establish the benefit of intensifying therapy for patients with EOI MRD .0.01%, which is now part of all COG protocols. This trial enrolled 5,311 patients with standard-risk B-ALL and used a 3-drug induction without anthracyclines (ie, dexamethasone, vincristine, and pegaspargase), with postinduction assignment into refined risk groups based on genetics and early response (ie, standard-risk low, standard-risk average, and standard-risk high).137 At the EOI, patients were randomized to receive standard consolidation (6-MP, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate) versus intensified consolidation (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-MP, vincristine, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate).137 For standard-risk low patients (ie, leukemic blasts were positive for triple trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 or were positive for ETV6-RUNX1 plus day 8 [or day 15] M1 bone marrow and day 29 MRD ,0.1%), the 5-year EFS and OS rates were 95% and 99%, respectively. The 5-year EFS and OS for all evaluable patients with standard risk disease was 89% and 96%, respectively, and intensified consolidation did not significantly improve outcomes for standard-risk average patients.137 Standard-risk high patients (day 15 bone marrow",

The 5-year DFS estimates for average risk patients who received oral methotrexate 20 mg/m2 /dose versus 40 mg/m2 /dose were similar (95% 6 2.4% vs 92.3% 6 2.9%; P5.95), suggesting that escalation of the methotrexate starting dose does not improve outcomes.139 The 5-year DFS (6standard error) for the average risk patients randomized to receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks was 94.1% 6 1.0% vs 95.1% 6 0.9% (one-sided P5.86).138\n\n#### COG AALL0232 and AALL1131\n\nThe AALL0232 trial enrolled 2,154 patients between the ages of 1 and 30 years who were diagnosed with high-risk B-cell ALL.140 In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone versus prednisone during induction and HD-MTX versus C-MTX plus pegaspargase during IM1. HD-MTX showed improved 5-year EFS (80% vs 75%; P5.008) and OS (88.9% 6 1.2% vs 86.1% 6 1.4%; P5.25) rates compared with C-MTX. No statistically significant difference was reported in the occurrence of mucositis, neurotoxicity, osteonecrosis, or other toxicities. The ALL0232 trial compared dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 /day for 14 days to prednisone 60 mg/m2 /day for 28 days. Dexamethasone showed improved outcomes\n\nduring induction in patients younger than 10 years of age; however, it was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis in patients 10 years of age or older. These data suggest that age may be an important factor for the selection of a corticosteroid.140\n\nRelative to pediatric patients with standard risk B-ALL, patients with high-risk B-ALL experience high relapse rates and worse clinical outcomes.128,141 Some approaches to combat this are investigating the integration of new agents into treatment after induction. The COG AALL1131 study was a phase III trial for patients aged 1–30 years with newly diagnosed high-risk B-ALL.142,143 Patients enrolled on this trial received a standard 4-drug induction (dexamethasone/prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and pegaspargase). One experimental arm of this study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide as part of multiagent chemotherapy.143 However, infectious toxicities precipitated the closure of this study arm. Another experimental arm investigated whether substituting postinduction chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine) with cyclophosphamide and etoposide would improve the 4-year DFS of pediatric patients with very high risk B-ALL.142 This substitution was not superior to the control arm. Given this experience, future therapeutic approaches will examine the utility of targeted agents. In this context, the COG has investigated the incorporation of dasatinib for newly diagnosed high-risk patients with Ph-like B-ALL harboring ABL-class lesions (AALL1131),59 and is investigating ruxolitinib for high-risk patients with newly diagnosed Ph-like ALL harboring CRLF2 rearrangements and/or a mutation that activates JAK-STAT pathway (AALL1521).144 In addition, ongoing trials are investigating whether the combination of immunotherapies with chemotherapy improves outcomes in certain subsets of patients (blinatumomab in standard-risk B-ALL: COG AALL1731; inotuzumab ozogamicin in high-risk B-ALL: COG AALL1732).\n\n#### DFCI ALL Protocols 05-001 and 16-001\n\nThe DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 enrolled 678 children and adolescent patients (aged 1–18 years of age) with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B-ALL, and tested a new risk stratification system.78 At study entry, patients were classified as standard risk or high risk and a 4-drug induction was used (prednisone, vincristine, doxorubicin, and pegaspargase).78 After achieving complete remission, patients with high EOI MRD (",

Of 498 patients, 492 (98.8%) entered complete remission (low risk, 99.6%; standard risk, 99.5%; and high risk, 90.4%). The 5-year EFS and OS estimates were 85.6% and 93.5%, resepectively.88 This study demonstrated that prophylactic cranial irradiation could be omitted without compromising OS.\n\nThe ongoing Total XVII Study will incorporate novel precision medicine strategies based on genomic features and targeted treatment.74 Some of these approaches include the use of NGS-based diagnostics. In addition, the Total XVII study will investigate the use of dasatinib in patients with ABL-class chimeric fusions identified by RNA sequencing, and ruxolitinib in patients with alterations that activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.74\n\n# Blinatumomab\n\nBlinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that directs CD3-positive effector memory T cells to CD19-positive target cells, inducing cell death.145,146 Blinatumomab first showed promising clinical efficacy as a means of eradicating persistent MRD after upfront chemotherapy. In a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study, Topp et al135 evaluated the efficacy of blinatumomab in MRD-positive patients with Ph-negative B-ALL (n521; age range, 20–77 years).

In addition, blinatumomab requires prolonged exposure for efficacy due to a short half-life (mean 6 standard deviation [SD]) of 1.2560.63 hours.178,179 The most significant toxicities noted in clinical studies are CNS events and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Neurologic toxicities have been reported in 50% of patients (median onset, 7 days) and grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicities, including encephalopathy, convulsions, and disorientation, have occurred in 15% of patients.178 CRS typically occurs within the first 2 days after start of blinatumomab infusion.178 Symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased transaminases, and increased total bilirubin. The incidence of adverse events can be reduced with monitoring for early intervention at onset of symptoms. However, the serious nature of these events underscores the importance of receiving treatment in a specialized cancer center that has experience with blinatumomab.\n\n# CAR T Cells\n\nOne of the early treatments for patients with advanced ALL included adoptive cell therapy to induce a graft-versusleukemia effect through allogeneic HSCT or donor lymphocyte infusions. However, this method resulted in a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease. To circumvent this issue, current advances are focused on the use of the patient's own T cells to target the B-ALL cells. The generation of CAR T cells to treat B-ALL is a significant advancement in the field.136,180–182 The treatment of patients with CAR T cells has served as a bridge for transplant, enabling patients who were formerly unable to receive a transplant due to poor remission status to achieve a CR and ultimately transplantation. It is also reported that patients who received CAR T cells can maintain longterm remission without subsequent HSCT.136 CAR T cell therapy relies on the genetic manipulation of a patients' T cells to generate a response against a leukemic cellsurface antigen, most commonly CD19.183 Briefly, T cells from the patient are harvested and engineered with a receptor that targets a cell surface tumor-specific antigen (eg, CD19 antigen on the surface of leukemic cells). The ability of CAR T cells to be reprogrammed to target any cell-surface antigen on leukemic cells is advantageous and avoids the issue of tumor evasion of the immune system via receptor downregulation, and studies of CAR T cells targeting antigens other than CD19 are ongoing.183 The manufacture of CAR T cells currently requires ex vivo viral transduction, activation, and expansion over several days to weeks to produce a sufficient cell number to engender disease response.184 Following infusion, debulking of tumors occurs in less than a week and these CAR T cells may remain in the body for extended periods of time to provide immunosurveillance against relapse.\n\nThere are several clinical trials using CAR T cells that differ in the receptor construct for patients with R/R ALL. A modified receptor, termed 19-28z—which links the CD19 binding receptor to the costimulatory protein CD28—demonstrated an overall CR in 14 of 16 patients with R/R B-cell ALL following infusion with CAR T cells.185 In addition, 7 of 16 patients were able to receive an allogeneic HSCT, suggesting that CAR T cells may provide a bridge to transplant.185 No relapse was observed in patients who had allogeneic HSCT (follow-up, 2–24 months); however, 2 deaths occurred from transplant complications. Follow-up data of adult patients enrolled on this trial (n553) showed an 83% CR rate after the infusion and 32 patients achieved an MRD-negative CR.186 At a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 1–65), the median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 8.7–23.4 months).186 KTE-C19 uses a similar anti-CD19 CAR construct and demonstrated an MRD-negative CR in 6 of 8 efficacy-evaluable adult patients with R/R ALL.187\n\nA second receptor construct defined by the attachment of an alternative costimulatory protein, 4-1BB, to the CD19 binding protein has shown similar results to the 19-28z CAR T cells in terms of overall CR.188 These cells, more simply referred to as CTL019, were infused into 16 children and 4 adults with R/R ALL; a CR after therapy was achieved in 14 patients.188 There was no response of the disease to treatment in 3 patients and disease response to therapy was still under evaluation for 3 patients.188 A follow-up study of 25 children and 5 adults showed a morphologic CR in 90% (27 of 30) of patients within a month of treatment and an OS of 78% (95% CI, 65%–95%) and EFS of 78% (95% CI, 51%–88%) at 6 months.189 There were 19 patients in sustained remission, 15 of whom received no further therapy. The ELIANA trial of CTL019/tisagenlecleucel in 75 children and young adults with R/R B-ALL demonstrated an overall remission rate of 81% within 3 months of infusion, all of which were notably MRD negative.136 This high response rate was associated with OS rates of 90% and 76% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. As with blinatumomab, T-cell activation was accompanied by severe CRS and neurologic toxicity, as well as higher infectious risks—though treatment-related mortality remains low.136 Given these data, CTL019/tisagenlecleucel was recommended for accelerated approval by the FDA oncologic drug advisory committee in July 2017 and fully approved by the FDA in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to age 25 years (aged ,26 years) with R/R precursor B-cell ALL.\n\nThe side effect profile of CAR T cells differs substantially from those observed with standard therapies (ie, chemotherapy, HSCT). Although side effects from CAR T cells may be severe, they have been reversible. Adverse events are attributed to CRS and macrophage activation that occur in direct response to adoptive cell transplant, resulting in high fever, hypotension, breathing difficulties, delirium, aphasia, and neurologic complications. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptor and antagonist of interleukin-6, and corticosteroids are the main options used to manage CRS and neurotoxicity symptoms.190,191 Several groups have developed comprehensive guidelines regarding grading systems for and management of CAR T-cell–associated toxicities.192,193\n\n#### Inotuzumab Ozogamicin\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is a calicheamicin-based antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22. Following the generation of encouraging single-agent phase II data,194 a randomized study was conducted comparing InO with standard intensive chemotherapy regimens in Ph-negative or Ph-positive ALL in first or second relapse, defined as .5% marrow blasts (n5326). Compared with standard therapy, InO produced a significantly higher CR/CRi rate (80.7% vs 29.4%; P,.001), and higher MRD-negative rates (78.4% vs 28.1%; P,.001).195 Notably, responses were consistent across most subgroups, including those with high marrow burden, and those with Ph-positive leukemia. The overall incidence of severe adverse events was similar across treatment arms, with a higher incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease observed in the inotuzumab group, related in part to dual alkylator-based transplant conditioning administered in remission. These data translated into a significant benefit in the median duration of remission (4.6 vs 3.1 months; P5.03), median PFS (5 vs 1.8 months; P,.001), and mean OS (13.9 vs 9.9 months; P5.005).195 In August 2017, InO received full approval from the FDA for the treatment of adults with R/R precursor B-cell ALL.\n\nHowever, pediatric experience with InO is limited. In a retrospective study of pediatric patients with R/R B-ALL (n551) who received InO in a compassionate use program, 67% of patients achieved CR and a majority of the responders were MRD-negative (71%).196 None of the patients developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during therapy, but 52% of patients who underwent HSCT following InO (11 of 21; 52%) developed SOS.196\n\n#### Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nFor patients with early relapse of B-ALL, HSCT is the only currently established curative modality. The CIBMTR group conducted an analysis of outcomes of patients with ALL (n5582; median age, 29 years; range, ,1–60 years) who underwent transplant during relapse.197 At 3 years, OS rates were 16% (95% CI, 13%–20%).197 Based on findings from evidence-based review of the published literature, the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy guidelines recommend HSCT for pediatric patients with ALL in CR2 after experiencing an early marrow relapse.198\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Ph-Negative or Ph-Like ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are initially grouped according to risk criteria (see PEDALL-3, page 85), and induction therapy consists of multiagent chemotherapy. Patients who are MRD negative after induction will continue risk-stratified therapy. Patients who are MRD positive after induction may undergo intensified consolidation therapy. If MRD remains persistent, other options include blinatumomab or tisagenlecleucel (category 2B recommendation). In all cases, HSCT may be considered as part of consolidation or maintenance therapy (see PEDALL-4, page 86).\n\nR/R Management For pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL experiencing early or late first relapse, the panel recommends initial treatment with systemic therapy (see PEDALL-9, page 91). If patients experience CR (CR2) and are MRD negative, the options are to continue on chemotherapy and receive maintenance therapy or HSCT if feasible based on the risk of subsequent relapse. If patients experience CR2 and are MRD positive, or are experiencing first relapse after a prior HSCT, in addition to chemotherapy, blinatumomab, tisagenlecleucel, and inotuzumab ozogamicin may be considered prior to either a first or second HSCT. If patients experience less than a CR (ie, multiple relapse), treatment options include chemotherapy, blinatumomab, tisagenlecleucel, or InO, and they may receive HSCT as consolidation therapy if their disease subsequently responds to therapy (see PEDALL-11, page 93). Long-term remissions have been also reported after tisagenlecleucel treatment without subsequent HSCT.136 If the disease does not respond to therapy, alternative treatment options may be considered with best supportive and palliative care (PEDALL-11, page 93).\n\n# Management of Ph-Positive B-ALL\n\nPh-positive ALL is relatively rare in pediatric patients, and the development of TKIs has improved previously poor treatment outcomes.54 The management of Ph-positive B-ALL as outlined in this discussion based on a number of clinical trials referenced in the algorithm, which are summarized below.\n\n# Front-line Management of Patients With Ph-Positive ALL\n\n# COG AALL0031 and AALL0622\n\nIn a multicenter study (COG AALL0031), children and adolescents with Ph-positive ALL (n592; aged 1–21 years) were treated with an intensive chemotherapy regimen combined with imatinib (340 mg/m2 /day; given during postremission induction therapy and maintenance).128 Among the cohort (n544) who received continuous imatinib exposure (280 consecutive days before maintenance initiation), the 3-year EFS rate was 80.5% (95% CI, 64.5%–89.8%). This outcome compared favorably with that of a historical population of patients with Ph-positive ALL (n5120) treated on a POG protocol, which showed a 3-year EFS rate of only 35% (P,.0001).128 Moreover, the 3-year EFS rates were similar among the groups of patients who received chemotherapy combined with continuous imatinib (88%; n525) or allogeneic HSCT from a related donor (57%; n521) or unrelated donor [URD] (72%; n511). No major toxicities were found to be associated with the addition of imatinib to the intensive chemotherapy regimen.128 Subsequent follow-up after 5 years confirmed these outcomes.129 In a phase II single-arm trial (COG AALL0622) of children and young adults with Ph-positive ALL (n560; aged 1–30 years), imatinib was replaced with dasatinib on induction day 15 and combined with the same chemotherapy used in COG AALL0031.130 The 5-year OS and EFS rates (6SD) were 86% 6 5% and 60% 6 7%, respectively, and outcomes were similar to those observed in COG AALL0031.130\n\n#### EsPhALL\n\nThe European intergroup study of postinduction treatment of Ph-chromosome positive ALL (EsPhALL) reported results of the randomized open-label trial designed to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of discontinuous postinduction imatinib plus chemotherapy with the BFM backbone intensive treatment versus chemotherapy alone.127 The study enrolled 108 good-risk and 70 poor-risk patients aged 1 year to 18 years. Good-risk patients were randomized 1:1 and poor-risk patients were all assigned to receive chemotherapy plus imatinib. There was a trend toward improved 4-year DFS for good-risk patients who received imatinib plus chemotherapy versus those who received chemotherapy alone (72.9% vs 61.7%; P5.24). In the as-treated analysis, good-risk patients who received imatinib with chemotherapy had a 4-year EFS of 75.2% versus 55.9% in patients who did not receive imatinib (P5.06). The incidence of serious adverse events was not statically different between the 2 groups (P5.64).127 Enrollment in this trial was stopped in 2009 following results of the COG AALL0031 study that demonstrated a benefit of continuous imatinib. The EsPhALL study was amended into a single-arm study to add continuous imatinib on induction day 15, with 97% of patients achieving first CR.126 However, the 5-year EFS and OS rates (57% and 71.8%, respectively) were similar in cohorts that received discontinuous postinduction imatinib and continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy with the BFM backbone intensive treatment.126,127 Additionally, a phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding continuous dasatinib at day 15 to the intensive BFM regimen in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (n5109 enrolled; age range, 1–17 years).199 The efficacy analysis included 104 patients, who all achieved CR; 15 of the patients received allogeneic HSCT in CR1. An interim analysis showed a 3-year EFS of 66.0% (95% CI, 54.8%–75.0%) and a 3-year OS of 92.3% (95% CI, 85.2%–96.1).199\n\n# St. Jude Total Therapy XV–XVII Studies\n\nIn the Total XVI study from the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Jeha et al sought to compare the response rates and overall clinical outcome of pediatric patients with Ph-positive ALL treated in the pre-TKI era versus with the current approach of incorporating a TKI.200 Patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL (n51035; age range, 1–18 years) were treated on low- and standard-/ high-risk arms, including 30 patients with Ph-positive ALL.200 The TKIs, imatinib or dasatinib were administered continuously through all phases of treatment starting on days 22 through 26 of remission induction therapy, and resulted in significant reductions in MRD when compared with the pre-TKI cohort that received chemotherapy alone (P,.001).200 The 5-year EFS for the TKI versus pre-TKI groups was 68.6619.2% and 31.669.9%, respectively (P5.022).200 In the Total XVII study, dasatinib will be given to patients with Ph-positive ALL and patients with ABL-class chimeric fusions (ie, involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, PDGFRA, or PDGFRB) identified by RNA-Seq.74 In this setting, dasatinib will be given on day 15 of remission induction.74\n\n#### Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nA retrospective analysis by Arico et al ` 201 reported significant improvement in 5-year DFS and OS for pediatric and AYA patients with Ph-positive ALL in CR1 who received HSCT, including matched related donor, matched URD, or mismatched related donor allogeneic SCT or autologous SCT, versus those who received chemotherapy alone without TKIs.198 In the large, international, collaborative MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 trial conducted in patients with previously untreated ALL, the subgroup with Ph-positive disease (n5267; median age, 40 years; range, 15–60 years) was eligible for allogeneic HSCT if patients were younger than 50 (in the ECOG E2993 trial) or 55 (in the MRC UKALL XII trial) years of age and had a matched sibling or matched URD.202 Among the Ph-positive patient cohort, postremission treatment included matched sibling allogeneic HSCT (n545), matched URD allogeneic HSCT (n531), and chemotherapy alone (n586). The 5-year OS rate according to postremission therapy was 44%, 36%, and 19%, respectively, and the 5-year EFS rate was 41%, 36%, and 9%, respectively.202 Both the OS and EFS outcomes for patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT (related or unrelated) were significantly improved compared with those who received only chemotherapy. The incidence of transplantrelated mortality was 27% with matched sibling allogeneic HSCT and 39% with matched URD HSCT. An intent-totreat analysis of patients with a matched sibling donor versus those without a matched sibling donor showed no statistically significant difference in 5-year OS rates (34% vs 25%, respectively).202\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the COG AALL0031 trial reported similar 3-year EFS rates among very high-risk patients with Ph-positive ALL in CR1 who received imatinib with intensive chemotherapy followed by HSCT or those who received chemotherapy with imatinib maintenance without HSCT.128,129,198\n\n# Management of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ph-Positive ALL\n\nAs previously mentioned, the outcomes of pediatric patients with R/R B-ALL has been historically poor. In Ph-positive ALL, several mechanisms may contribute to this including the development of resistance to TKIs.54 Several trials referenced in the algorithm have developed regimens that are currently used to treat R/R Ph-positive B-ALL, and these studies are summarized subsequently.\n\n# Chemotherapy and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\n\nIn a phase I study, the efficacy and toxicity of imatinib was evaluated in pediatric patients with R/R Ph-positive leukemia, including cases of ALL, AML, and chronic myeloid leukemia (n531).203 In this study, imatinib demonstrated a good toxicity profile and was well tolerated at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m2 /day. Among patients with ALL evaluable for morphologic response (n510), 7 achieved an M1 and 1 achieved an M2 bone marrow.203 In the COG AALL0031 study, pediatric patients with Ph-positive ALL who relapsed after initial treatment with imatinib and chemotherapy were able to achieve an overall CR2 rate of 67% (n520/30).129 Of the patients who attained CR2, 85% (n517/20) remained in remission for at least 3 months.129\n\n# Blinatumomab\n\nAn open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in adult patients (aged",

The median DFS and OS were both 20 weeks and the 1-year OS rate was 28%. Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was common, but only one case of grade 4 CNS toxicity (reversible) was observed.212\n\nIn a phase I trial, NECTAR, the efficacy and safety of nelarabine in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide was evaluated in children with R/R T-ALL or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (n519).213 Of evaluable patients with R/R T-ALL (n59), a 44% response rate was observed.213\n\n# Bortezomib-Based Regimens\n\nThe referenced study, COG AALL07P1, evaluating a bortezomib-containing regimen included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.163 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# UKALL R3\n\nThe referenced study, UKALL R3, evaluating the effect of mitoxantrone in multiple risk-stratified chemotherapy blocks included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.157,159 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# ALL-REZ BFM 90\n\nThe referenced study, ALL-REZ BFM 90, evaluating riskstratified multichemotherapy blocks, included pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL.160 For a summary, refer to \"Management of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL\" (page 96).\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nHSCT is the only curative treatment of R/R T-ALL, but this requires successful remission induction and the data are limited.83 In the COG AALL01P2 study, most patients with T-ALL (n55 of 7) did not experience CR2.161 In the MRC UKALL R1 trial, compared with chemotherapy alone, allogeneic HSCT did not significantly improve EFS in pediatric patients with R/R ALL.214\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for T-ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that pediatric and AYA patients with T-ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are treated with chemotherapy (see PEDALL-6, page 88). After a response assessment, standard- or high-risk patients continue consolidation chemotherapy. The features that define standard risk in this context are: day 29 MRD ,0.01%, CNS-1, absence of testicular disease, and no steroid pretreatment. Very-high-risk patients have end of consolidation MRD .0.1%. High-risk patients in this context do not exhibit any standard- or very high risk factors. Patients who have very high risk features may continue chemotherapy or pursue alternative therapy and consider HSCT as part of consolidation therapy. However, it is recommended that additional therapy be given to achieve MRD negativity before HSCT.\n\nR/R Management For pediatric and AYA patients with T-ALL experiencing first relapse, the panel recommends initial treatment with clinical trial or chemotherapy (see PEDALL-10, page 92). If patients experience CR2, consolidation therapy with chemotherapy should be continued with HSCT. If patients experience less than CR (ie, multiple relapse), treatment options include chemotherapy, and patients may receive HSCT as consolidation therapy if they subsequently respond to therapy (see PEDALL-11, page 93). If the disease does not respond to therapy, alternative treatment options may be considered with best supportive and palliative care (see PEDALL-11, page 93).\n\n# Management of Infant ALL\n\nMost infant patients with ALL present with aggressive features, including high WBC counts, CNS involvement, and leukemia cutis, necessitating the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens.34 However, infant patients are especially vulnerable to treatment-related toxicities, so clinical trials are continually investigating novel strategies to reduce this.34 Based on trials referenced in the algorithm, the management of infant ALL is summarized in subsequent sections.\n\n# Front-line Management of Infants With ALL\n\n# Interfant-99\n\nIn a multicenter Interfant-99 trial, 482 infant patients with ALL, aged 0 to 12 months, were risk-stratified according to peripheral blood response to a 7-day prednisone prophase, and treated with a hybrid protocol that incorporated elements of standard ALL and AML regimens.36 Response was defined as good, and risk as standard, if the blast count in peripheral blood at day 8 was ,1000 cells/ml.

Patients in the medium- and high-risk groups were randomly assigned to receive a lymphoid consolidation course (low-dose cytarabine, 6-MP, and cyclophosphamide [IB]) or experimental myeloid courses (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide [ADE]; and mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and etoposide [MAE]). The 6-year EFS and OS probabilities of all patients were 46.1% and 58.2%, respectively.9 The 6-year probability of DFS was comparable for the randomized arms (ADE1MAE 39.3% vs IB 36.8%; log-rank P5.47).9\n\n# COG AALL0631\n\nBased on data showing aberrant activation of FLT3 pathway in infant ALL with KMT2A rearrangements,217–219 the COG AALL0631 trial was designed to evaluate whether the addition of a FLT3 TKI, lestaurtinib, to postinduction chemotherapy would increase treatment efficacy in infants with newly diagnosed ALL.34,220 Initial induction consisted of 3 weeks of therapy based on a COG P9407 backbone (cohort 1).220,221 Differences between the revised COG P9407 induction and the AALL0631 induction included use of low-dose cytarabine instead of cyclophosphamide, decreased daunorubicin dose and substitution of native L-asparaginase with pegaspargase.220 Due to excessive induction toxicity, the study was amended to include a modified 5-week Interfant-99 based induction and enhanced supportive care guidelines (cohort 2).220 Induction mortality and sterile site infections were significantly lower for patients in cohort 2, and higher complete response rates were observed at the endinduction intensification for cohort 2 (week 9, n594/100 [94%]) versus cohort 1 (week 7, n517/25 [68%]; P5.0012).220 The addition of lestaurtinib did not demonstrate a benefit in outcomes.34\n\n# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant\n\nThe benefit derived from using HSCT in infant leukemia is unclear.34 Several retrospective studies suggest no clinical advantage or a benefit at low EFS rates.222 In the Interfant-99 study, only a subgroup of infant patients with KMT2A-rearranged ALL and additional poor prognostic factors (age ,6 months, poor response to steroids at day 8, high WBC) appeared to benefit from HSCT in CR1 over chemotherapy alone.125\n\n## Management of Infant Patients With Relapsed or Refractory ALL\n\nInfant patients with R/R ALL have poor outcomes, and few studies have focused on this specific group.223,224 Studies summarized previously for B-ALL and T-ALL include some infant patients, and those management strategies apply in this context.\n\n# NCCN Recommendations for Infant ALL\n\nFront-line Management The panel recommends that infant patients with ALL be treated in a clinical trial when possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, patients are treated with Interfant-based chemotherapy (see PEDALL-7, page 89). To ensure appropriate consolidation, it is important to assess the KMT2A status of the disease. If the patient is standard-risk (ie, KMT2A not rearranged), after a response assessment, the patient may be treated with Interfant-based consolidation. Alternatively, patients who are MRD negative after induction will continue risk-stratified chemotherapy similar to what has been described for Ph-negative or Ph-like ALL. Patients who are MRD positive after induction may undergo intensified consolidation therapy. In all cases, HSCT may be considered as part of consolidation or maintenance therapy (see PEDALL-7, page 89).\n\nIf the patient has KMT2A rearranged, he or she is treated with an intensive Interfant-based consolidation chemotherapy.
